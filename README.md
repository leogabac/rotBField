Rotation about the y axis for 60s.\
1mT constant field

**Test 2**\
Ramp up to 5mT for 60s\
Rotation about the y axis for 60s

**Test 3**\
Rotated field at 60 degrees\

Constant field for 120s

**Test 6**\
Simulated Annealing

**Test 7**\
Improved simulated annealing w. loops.

**Test 8**\
Evolution of 90deg GS.
8mT constant field for 60s.

**Test 9**\
Lots of Simulated Annealing for $\theta$.

**Test 10**\
Chirality computations

**Test 11**\
Getting the GS for all angles + order parameters.
Here the draw_frame is used.
Parallelized.

**Test 12**\
Same as 11.
Thermal ice

**Test 13**\
Vertices counting (Used for poster)
